But you still can use only bronze funnel and tunnel.</p></hint>",

But worry, not, it is possible! You can use entity link from UnlimitedPeripheralWorks for wireless contraption access. To bind entity card to contraption, just stay close to it, hold wrench in the left hand and use right click while crouching</p></hint>"
